    <h1>Git from vscode</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set
      of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers
      collaboratively developing source code during software development. While
      Git is a tool that is used to manage multiple versions of source code
      edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub
      serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.
